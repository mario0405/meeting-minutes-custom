# Protocolito v0.1.18

Thanks for using Protocolito! This release includes reliability fixes, UI improvements, and updated defaults.

## Downloads
Choose the file that matches your OS:

| OS | Download file |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | `.msi` (installer) or `.exe` (portable) |
| macOS | `.dmg` |
| Linux | `.AppImage` (portable), `.deb`, or `.rpm` |

Notes:
- Bundle archives (`bundle-*.zip` / `bundle-*.tar.gz`) contain all artifacts for that OS.
- If you are unsure on Linux, start with the `.AppImage`.

## Changes since v0.1.16 and v0.1.17
- More reliable transcription completion, recording saves, and status reporting.
- Release builds now log to a file and use bundled FFmpeg for merge operations.
- Dark mode toggle plus UI cleanup (About modal, sidebar version, recording notice text).
- Default storage paths renamed to protocolito (recordings, templates, notifications, models).
- Updated "Demnaechst" roadmap text and simplified README.
